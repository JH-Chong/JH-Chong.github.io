				<p>Ranks in Go are used to indicate a player's skill in the game and they are measured using kyo and dan grades. Kyu grades, abbreviated as k, are considered student grades and decrease as playing level increases, meaning that the 1st kyo is the strongest available kyu grade. Dan grades, abbreviated as d, are considered master grades and they increase from 1st dan to 7th dan. Professional players have professional dan grades, abbreviated as p, and they are separated from amateur ranks. For beginners, the range of ranks will be from 30k to 21k. For casual players, the range of ranks will be from 20k to 1k. For intermediate players, the range of ranks will be from 9k to 1k. For advanced players, the range of ranks will be from 1d to 7d. Lastly, for professional players, the range of ranks will be from 1p to 9p.</p>
